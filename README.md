# About Techvalore
This project show a concept about an ecommerce website that aims towards tech enthusiast that like hardware technology and accessories. Where user can browse through different product to their likings and do not rely on generic ecommerce selling different stuff. So if user like everything about technology and wants to get their hands on the latest technology, this is the website for you! 

# Design Process
When we planned out the application, we knew we wanted tech enthusiasts to be our main target audience through this website, we hope to bring convenience to our consumers and ensuring our website design and layout to be simple and minimalistic.
We knew that we did not want the website that is overcrowded, driving users away from their main goal which is browsing through the website and enjoying the perks along with it. Our website is pretty straightforward, and it is generous with it's perks.
- As a user, I want to be able to obtain vouchers so i can purchase items at a discounted price
- As a user, I want to be able to enjoy the perks of the application so i want to be able to make routine purchases and login to the application to earn coins

- Login cannot use the user data after registering in the register page, as this part is simulated and can be login without putting anything
- Minigames can only win 3 coins as this is simulated as well and cannot be added uniquely to the user data
- Discount and shipping are pre-defined as this is also simulated and shown as a concept only
